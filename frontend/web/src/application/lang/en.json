And how do research, innovation and corporate collaborations at the university influence the evolution of industry? The MIK - PARTNERS ' Day - Baranya County Engineers' Day at the Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology of the University of Pécs on October 7, 2021 is looking for answers to these and similar questions. An important aspect of this year's event is the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Faculty, but just like previous events, it also serves to present the results of the institution's extensive partner network in education, R&D and industrial innovation knowledge transfer.",
  "main_page_paragraph2": "The 2021 program titled University- Industry 5.0; Technical Higher Education in Engineering 2050+, besides strengthening the relationship between the Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology of UP and its professional partner network, facilitates an innovative system of cooperation among its participants and formulates the challenges of professional training and tendering activities in a university environment. In addition, it emphasizes the importance of practice-oriented training of our students and preparation for labor market expectations, as well as provides an opportunity to get to know the partners’ profile.",
  "main_page_paragraph3": "MIK - PARTNERS’ Day 2021 merges innovative knowledge competencies of different fields of engineering, results of practice-oriented research in higher education in addition to providing an advocacy forum of chamber organizations representing engineers (BMMK, PBKIK, DDÉK) at the same time and in the same place.",
  "main_page_paragraph4": "In the morning program, following the presentation of the film and publication prepared for the 50th anniversary of the Faculty, plenary sessions will address the future of higher education in engineering and the relationship between biocybernetics and medical robotics. Following this, participants can learn about “Zero Carbon Cities” approach through a university architectural project: Solar Decathlon 2021. In the afternoon, in the frames of 10 sessions, researchers and professional partners of the Faculty will introduce their research, innovation and professional field in 20-minute presentations touching on 19 topics. \nGiven that the Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology celebrated its 50th anniversary last year, we will inaugurate a memorial statue on the grounds of the institution to mark the occasion.",
  "main_page_paragraph5": "At MIK Partners’ Day - which is part of the PTE Centennial program series -, our goal is to further develop our high quality and extensive partner network, to represent the R & D & I activities of engineering disciplines at national and international level, in the fields of education, research and corporate cooperation.",
